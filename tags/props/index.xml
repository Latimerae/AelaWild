      <description>Here’s my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by Edu Puertas on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. The prize is a noxon slider. Of course a slider would change the way I work and improve my process, but I loved the idea of the challenge. I only had a five days to make it, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.</description>

      <description>This year’s Stop-Mo Jam, hosted over at Stop Motion Animation, had a Halloween theme!
That’s my jam.I’ve been working hard to limit my projects, so I finished Stars of Stone first, in the last days of August. And then right away I rolled into prop-making for this one.
First, six or seven thin layers of paper strips in PVA glue on a baloon, then a layer of soaked and shredded egg cartons with PVA, too.</description>
