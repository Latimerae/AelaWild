      <description>Here’s my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by Edu Puertas on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. I hadn’t done camera movement yet so it was a great chance to get my feet wet panning and rotating the camera. I didn’t win but I had so much fun making this video and I know I’ve learned heaps. I only had about five days to make it, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.</description>

      <description>Now that the short is done I can finally share the years of footage and photos documenting the making-of process. I’m getting those into video format for YouTube, so expect a few short videos on the puppets, sets, and deleted scenes.

      <description>Great news, Rook’s first adventure is complete. It’s currently doing the rounds of some film festivals, so I can’t share it publicly or it would be disqualified. Thankfully my lovely Patreon supporters get early access now because donors are allowed to see it early!
Here’s a little teaser.
  I would love to know what you think!</description>
