      <description>Here’s my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by Edu Puertas on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. The prize is a noxon slider. Of course a slider would change the way I work and improve my process, but I loved the idea of the challenge. I only had a five days to make it, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.</description>

      <description>I’ve made graphics for a few researchers at this point, so I was happy when my partner Timothee Bonnet needed some animal graphics for his projects. I was happy to oblige and they turned out pretty cute.
If you’d like something similar for a project of yours, get in touch and we can discuss pricing.</description>
