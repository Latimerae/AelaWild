      <description>Here’s my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by Edu Puertas on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. I hadn’t done camera movement yet so it was a great chance to get my feet wet panning and rotating the camera. I didn’t win but I had so much fun making this video and I know I’ve learned heaps. I only had about five days to make it, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.</description>

      <description>It’s winter here in Australia and our front door has a weird doorstop and a huge gap below the door, so I designed a weirdo bird to fit under it. I originally wanted it to be a bittern and was planning on painting it, but I couldn’t bring myself to change it from egret form.
Then, after I made it, I used a thermal camera to have a look and see if it made a difference.</description>
