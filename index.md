# Aelawild

Hi! Thanks for coming, it's nice you're here. 

I'm <i>Aela Wild</i> (Dr. Ashley E Latimer) a paleontologist and maker in Canberra, Australia. I want to share cool things about critters you've never seen and make it fun.

Check out some videos, articles, or the follies of a birdwatcher or have a look at some of my favorite things on the web. 
 
Do you need a graphic, an animation, or some 3D work? Have a look at my portfolio. Like what you see? Request a commission!
 
Want more? Support my work on Patreon to help me create faster and get some bonus lasercutter templates, tutorials, and other fun content.
 
Thanks for visiting, hope to see you around!
 
Aela
