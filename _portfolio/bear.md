This American black bear (Ursus americanus) was donated to the ANU to raise awareness of illegal trafficing and animal imports. Along the way, the bear lost the fishy mouthful she had and was feeling a bit toothless. The Ecology and Evolution group at the Australian National University tasked me with fiting her for prosthesis and doing a touch-up. This included cleaning the mouth and preparing it for new teeth, 3D printing some teeth from a CT scan, editing them down to fit the bear's age, sculpting a new palate seating and painting it. Her ear was also torn and needed to be re-attached, and the base was re-covered and a nice branch added.
