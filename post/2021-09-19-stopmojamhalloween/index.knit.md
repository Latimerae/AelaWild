This year's Stop-Mo Jam, hosted over at [Stop Motion Animation](https://www.stopmotionanimation.com), had a Halloween theme! 

That's my jam.
I've been working hard to limit my projects, so I finished Stars of Stone first, in the last days of August. And then right away I rolled into prop-making for this one.

First, six or seven thin layers of paper strips in PVA glue on a baloon, then a  layer of soaked and shredded egg cartons with PVA, too. Then paper strips again.



This pumpkin took the longest, and I'm still finding bits of orange papier-mâché in odd places around the house.

Then the angler fish needed to produce its own light so I hunted around for some spare LEDs and made a little circuit and a wire frame for the beast.

And then it wasn't bright enough in the lighting tests so I ordered a few new LEDs, thankfully the stores are open for pickup, despite lockdown.

More papier-mâché, some epoxy and paint, and some toothpick ends finished up the beast. Looks pretty cute on set.

A few painful nights of animation later with some very quick sound design and it was done. I hope I don't come up with more ideas for low-light animation again soon. Gotta say, my Canon R5 took the photos like a champ.

You can see more of the making-of coming soon to my YouTube, and the final product will be available shortly! (Hehehe)
