Exciting news, Save the Snakes, a great organization that helps mediate human-snake conflict and show what great animals snakes are, commissioned me to make a 30 second short for them. It was a wonderful collaboration, thanks so much for the opportunity!

You can check out Save the Snakes here: https://savethesnakes.org/
And watch the 30s short here, fittingly released on Natonal Serpent day.

And here's a making-of video for you to enjoy on my channel :)

I hope this little short makes a positive difference for snakes!


Until next time,
