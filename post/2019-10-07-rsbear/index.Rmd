This American black bear (*Ursus americanus*) was donated to the ANU to raise awareness of illegal trafficking and animal imports. Along the way, the bear lost her original fishy mouthful was feeling a bit toothless. The Ecology and Evolution group at the Australian National University tasked me with fitting her for prosthesis and doing a touch-up. This included cleaning the mouth and preparing it for new teeth, 3D printing some teeth from a CT scan, editing them down to fit the bear's age, sculpting a new palate seating and painting it. Her ear was also torn and needed to be re-attached, and the base was re-covered and a nice branch added.

Thanks to Scott for hiring me to give this gummy bear a toothy grin.
