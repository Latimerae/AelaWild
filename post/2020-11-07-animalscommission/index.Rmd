I've made graphics for a few researchers at this point, so I was happy when my partner [Timothee Bonnet](https://timotheenivalis.github.io//) needed some animal graphics for his projects. I was happy to oblige and they turned out pretty cute.


If you'd like something similar for a project of yours, [get in touch](https://aelawild.com/contact) and we can discuss pricing.![](/images/PCFWSkinkbig.png)
