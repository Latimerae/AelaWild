It's winter here in Australia and our front door has a weird doorstop and a huge gap below the door, so I designed a weirdo bird to fit under it. I originally wanted it to be a bittern and was planning on painting it, but I couldn't bring myself to change it from egret form.

Then, after I made it, I used a thermal camera to have a look and see if it made a difference.

Here's the door again with the egret in place. Darker colors are colder.

You can really see the shadow of the egret when I remove it, here. It was keeping most of the cold from entering. The difference is pretty stark!

Now that I've seen the thermal images, iI would make the neck relatively shorter and body longer to insulate as much as possible, but the bird has so much character, I don't (r)egret a thing.
