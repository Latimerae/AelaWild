Here's my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by [Edu Puertas](https://www.youtube.com/c/edupuertasfruns) on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. The prize is a noxon slider. Of course a slider would change the way I work and improve my process, but I loved the idea of the challenge. I only had a five days to make it, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
