Here's my entry for the Noxon Challenge proposed by [Edu Puertas](https://www.youtube.com/c/edupuertasfruns) on youtube! The challenge was to create a 10 second short with camera movement. I hadn't done camera movement yet so it was a great chance to get my feet wet with a pan and a rotate. I didn't win the challenge but I had so much fun making this video and I know I've learned from this one! I only had about five days to make it, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
